# Sagacity
A simple library for building, training and using neural networks.

The code compiles on Linux (haven't tryed it on Windows) but no tests exist (yet) so there is no guarantee that it works.

Future goals:
  - Separate the training algorithm from the network
  - Make it possible to save networks
  - Maybe make bindings for Python and Java

In order to build this project you'll need to have the following packages:
  - build-essential
  - cmake

If you also want to build the tests you'll need to install:
  - libboost-test-dev

The project only contains some very basic tests and needs better ones.
